OCR Exercise
============

Running examples

The bin folder contains example programs corresponding to the three stages of the exercise. They contain sample data and can be run simply with:

    $ ruby bin/ex3.rb

Alternatively an input file can be provided:

    $ ruby bin/ex3.rb test_data.txt

Output is written to stdout. To write to file, redirect within the shell:

    $ ruby bin/ex3.rb test_data.txt > output.txt
